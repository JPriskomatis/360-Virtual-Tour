This will be the tracklist/checklist of Tasks to implement for the virtual tour:

1) Start Screen:
    -Should have a welcome message;
    -(Optional) Audio & Language buttons if we decide to have;
    -Start Button;

2) Info Hot Spots:
    -We can have information panels with text & media being displayed when
     the viewer clicks on some info points, e.g. explain what courses we do,
     how often to have them, how many graduates there are or what technologies;

3) Scenes should be connected by physical distance:
    Meaning that scene 1 -> 2 should be right next to each other;

4) Have the "EXIT" signs be the hotspots to click to go to the next room;
    -We can edit the text and instead of having "EXIT" it can be the next room's name,
    e.g. "Main Corridor", "Teaching Room #1";

5) Juxtaposition photos:
    -Some rooms can have an info panel that displays a before & after of the school;

6) "Fun Facts":
    -We can implement some facts aboout the school that are floating texts that appear
     as you navigate the school;

7) Small quizes in specific classrooms:
    -Based on if the viewer is inside a classroom we can create a small easy quiz based on the
    classroom's teaching material;

8) UI glass-like panel at top left for title

9) Location for next scene: White circle that on hover draws a line

10) Arrow on hover -> Grow in size and no cylinder
